Welcome to my repo for Start.NG, a free software development training program targetted at beginners in tech. This repo will chronicle my tasks as I journey through the program. Come with me on this amazing trip and feel free to critic my codes, send a PR or recommend a learning resource (preferrablly NOT video because internet data is very expensive here).
